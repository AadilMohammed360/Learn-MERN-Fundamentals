React: Read Operation

- our goal is to read student list from db

- if we hit https://localhost:5000/api/students
  via a 'get request' (just like sending a follow
  request in facebook or instagram) we will fetch
  document rows from db through express backend

- if we want to print the JSON document rows from
  mongodb into some html element like an unordered list
  first we need to store it in some useState variable
  in react first

- let that variable be named students initialised to
  type [] and let setStudents be a function used to 
  assign data to that variable called students

- we will then use fetch api to make the get request
  and a response will be received containing data from
  db through backend wich we will store in useState
  variable named students using the function
  setStudents which is a useState function

- then all we need to do is read each individual row
  from students array using map function that works
  similar to php foreach loop

- s is the the alias given to current iteration row

- s.name, s.age, s.email will give each column data of
  current row from iteration

- useEffect is used to perform this entire student list
  printing operation once at the beginning of page load


React: Delete Operation

- when we generate a html list item element to print
  current student row data using students variable
  (the useState variable of type=list, using alias s)
  and map function (acting like a foreach loop) we
  can also generate a html button element inside
  the list item element during that iteration
- we can then pass current iteration student id to
  that button while it is being printed

- we can then use onclick event to track when we click
  that button to pass the id of the student row whose
  delete button u clicked and run a function that will
  hit https://localhost:5000/api/students/<id> at the
  backend using a DELETE request and delete record
  in db with matching id

React: Insertion Operation

- For inserting data to db we need to create a form
  element in html
- we can define it in the return part of our App.js
- then all we need to do is hit the url
  https://localhost:5000/api/students with a POST type
  request
- Just before making the POST request we need to store
  the current form data from frontend using the useState
  variable called form and simply passing that form
  variable to the POST request in JSON format
- setForm is a useState function that will update the
  values being typed to every input element inside
  the form
- we will trigger setForm function to update the values
  of form variable during the event when a user types
  something to any input element in the form
- this is done by binding the onchange event handler to
  every input element in the form

React: Updation Operation
- Just like in deletion operation we pass the entire 
  student row instead of id (using the s alias) whose
  edit button was clicked to a function named
  handleEdit function
- handleEdit function using the received s alias
  containing the entire student row uses it show
  current name, email, age values of the student we
  are about to edit inside the input elements of the
  form
- we also store the id of the student we are editing
  in a useState variable called Editing Id
- when we click the submit button, it will first check
  for the existence of an Editing Id, if present
  then it will hit https://localhost:5000/api/students
  with a PUT request instead of the normal POST request
- since the type of request made was PUT, it updates
  the record matching the editing Id and then resets
  editing Id back to null
- if editing Id wasn't present it means we never
  clicked any edit button and clicked the submit button
- so it will make POST request to insert a record
  instead
